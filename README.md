### New Enemy
The shadow player is the player’s arch nemesis. His movement is a mix of both the rogue’s and the skeleton’s, moving one grid position toward the player every once every second. He is also persistent to the point of irrationality. Upon being killed he will return after a short time

### New Player Character
Giles is a unique creation that definitely doesn’t infringe on any international copyrights. He is able to defeat enemies with his generic projectile and backflip kick.
